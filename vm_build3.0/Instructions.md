1 - ) YOU NEED TO ENABLE YOUR CPU VIRTUALIZATION IN BIOS. 
This process may vary depending on your processor brand. 
You can seek help from the internet on how to perform this operation.


2 - ) After enabling virtualization for your processor, the next step is to download the file named "leomoon cpu-v" from the link I provided. 
Once you've downloaded the file, run it. If both sides show a green checkmark as you see in the image, you can skip the next steps and proceed to setting up the virtual machine.

Unless you have any significantly different issues, you are ready to set up your virtual machines. 
If, despite these steps, you still don't see two green checkmarks in the leomoon cpu-v program, you can send me a message for further assistance.

1 - ) Type 'winver' into the Windows search bar. Click the result. If you see '2H22' in the line I marked with red in the image, download VMware Workstation version 17. If a lower version is displayed, download VMware Workstation version 16.

VMware version 17 :  https://www.filehorse.com/download-vmware-workstation/
License Key : ZV3JH-4LXE1-M88MZ-HQXXX-XG0FD

VMware version 16 : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N5TFs-aEv0LaG5-Teo7JTGI5gG72i9z1?hl=ru
License Key : ZF3R0-FHED2-M80TY-8QYGC-N[P]KYF 


2 - ) Download the file 'vm3.0.rar'. As shown in the video, create a file named "VM" on your desktop or in a location of your choice. 
The folder's name is not crucial; you can give it any name you prefer. Make sure the disk where the folder is located is a SSD. Afterward, copy the contents of the 'vm3.0.rar' file into the folder you created.
PS : One VM needs approximately 55-60 gigabytes of space on your disk at max. Please keep this in your mind.

3 - ) Copy the contents of the config file into the VM folder you created.

4 - ) Run the VMware program. 



PS : The amount of RAM and CPU you allocate to the virtual machine is up to you, but our recommendation is a minimum of 4 GB for RAM and 3 threads for the CPU.
